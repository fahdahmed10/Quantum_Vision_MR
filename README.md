## 🧪 Core Principles

### 🔑 The Broken Law
We redefine quantum mechanics by controlling **quantum tunneling probabilities**, enabling particles like quantum dots to "teleport" through barriers and arrive precisely at their target.

### 🌟 What Are Quantum Dots?
Quantum dots (QDs) are nanoscale particles with unique optical and electronic properties due to quantum confinement. **BioSensQD** is custom-engineered with features like:
- **Boron Doping** for magnetic responsiveness.
- **Ligand Coating** for tissue targeting.
- **Biocompatible Surface** for safe biological interaction.
